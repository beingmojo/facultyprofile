        <!--
            Here is a brief description of the important parts of the above html code:
            * enctype="multipart/form-data" - Necessary for our to-be-created PHP file to function properly.
            * action="uploader.php" - The name of our PHP page that will be created, shortly.
            * method="POST" - Informs the browser that we want to send information to the server using POST.
            * input type="hidden" name="MA... - Sets the maximum allowable file size, in bytes, that can be
              uploaded. This safety mechanism is easily bypassed and we will show a solid backup solution in PHP.
              We have set the max file size to 100KB in this example.
            * input name="uploadedfile" - uploadedfile is how we will access the file in our PHP script.

            Typically, the PHP file should make a key decision with all uploads: keep the file or throw it away.
            A file might be thrown away for many reasons, including:
            * The file is too large and you do not want to have it on your server.
            * You wanted the person to upload a picture and they uploaded something else, like an executable file (.exe).
            * There were problems uploading the file and so you can't keep it.
            This example is very simple and omits the code that would add such functionality.

            When the php file is executed, the uploaded file exists in a temporary storage area on the server.
            If the file is not moved to a different location it will be destroyed! To save our precious file
            we are going to need to make use of the $_FILES associative array.
            The $_FILES array is where PHP stores all the information about files.
            There are two elements of this array that we will need to understand for this example.
            * uploadedfile - uploadedfile is the reference we assigned in our HTML form.
              We will need this to tell the $_FILES array which file we want to play around with.
            * $_FILES['uploadedfile']['name'] - name contains the original path of the user uploaded file.
            * $_FILES['uploadedfile']['tmp_name'] - tmp_name contains the path to the temporary file that
              resides on the server. The file should exist on the server in a temporary directory with a
              temporary name.
            Now we can finally start to write a basic PHP upload manager script! Here is how we would get
            the temporary file name, choose a permanent name, and choose a place to store the file.
