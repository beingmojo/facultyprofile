            Using PHP to upload files into MySQL database sometimes needed by
            some web application. For instance for storing pdf documents or
            images to make some kind of online briefcase (like Yahoo briefcase).
            For the first step, let's make the table for the upload files.
            The table will consist of.
            * 1. id : Unique id for each file
            * 2. name : File name
            * 3. type : File content type
            * 4. size : File size
            * 5. content : The file itself

            For column content we'll use BLOB data type. BLOB is a binary large
            object that can hold a variable amount of data. MySQL have four BLOB
            data types, they are :
            * TINYBLOB
            * BLOB
            * MEDIUMBLOB
            * LONGBLOB
            Since BLOB is limited to store up to 64 kilobytes of data we will
            use MEDIUMBLOB so we can store larger files ( up to 16 megabytes ).

            * CREATE TABLE upload (
            *      id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
            *      name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
            *      type VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
            *      size INT NOT NULL,
            *      content MEDIUMBLOB NOT NULL,
            *      PRIMARY KEY(id)
            * );

            Uploading a file to MySQL is a two step process. First you need to
            upload the file to the server then read the file and insert it to
            MySQL. For uploading a file we need a form for the user to enter the
            file name or browse their computer and select a file. The input
            type="file" is used for that purpose. After the form is submitted
            then we need to read the autoglobal $_FILES. In the example above
            the input name for the file is userfile so the content of $_FILES
            are like this :
            * $_FILES['userfile']['name'] -- The original name of the file on
              the client machine.
            * $_FILES['userfile']['type'] -- The mime type of the file, if the
              browser provided this information. An example would be "image/gif"
            * $_FILES['userfile']['size'] -- The size, in bytes, of the uploaded
              file.
            * $_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name'] -- The temporary filename of the
              file in which the uploaded file was stored on the server.
            * $_FILES['userfile']['error'] -- The error code associated with
              this file upload. ['error'] was added in PHP 4.2.0
            Example : file_db_upload.php
        -->
        <form action="file_db_upload3.php" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
            <table width="350" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" class="box">
                <tr>
                    <td width="246">
                        <input type="hidden" name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value="2000000">
                        <input name="userfile" type="file" id="userfile">
                    </td>
                    <td width="80"><input name="upload" type="submit" class="box" id="upload" value=" Upload "></td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </form>
    </body>
