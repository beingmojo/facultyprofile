            <label for="file">Filename:</label>
            <input type="file" name="file" id="file" /><br />

        <!--
            Notice the following about the HTML form above:
            * The enctype attribute of the <form> tag specifies which content-type
              to use when submitting the form. "multipart/form-data" is used when
              a form requires binary data, like the contents of a file, to be uploaded
            * The type="file" attribute of the <input> tag specifies that the input
              should be processed as a file. For example, when viewed in a browser,
              there will be a browse-button next to the input field
            Note: Allowing users to upload files is a big security risk. Only permit
            trusted users to perform file uploads.

            Create The Upload Script: The "uploader2.php" file contains the code for
            uploading a file
