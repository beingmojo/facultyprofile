      <p><br />
        The consent form submitted to the IRB for approval <u>MUST</u> address/include  the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>&ldquo;Consent Form&rdquo; must be the title of the  document, not &ldquo;Informed Consent&rdquo;. Informed consent is considered an action or  an ongoing process of communication between the participant and the researcher.</li>
        <li>The consent form should be written in  language that is easily understood by prospective subjects. Many consider it  most appropriate to write the consent form between 5th and 8th  grade reading levels. </li>
        <li>Depending on the target population, the  consent form (and other relevant documents) may be required to be written in a  language other than English. Translating documents is typically accomplished by  having a qualified individual translate the document(s) from English to  Spanish, then having a second qualified person translate the resulting Spanish  version back to English. This is done to ensure that the meaning embodied in  the document is retained and that the document(s) was not merely translated  &ldquo;word-for-word.&rdquo; Also, the researcher should consider whether an interpreter  should be present during data collection. If not, justification should be  provided.</li>
        <li>Give the  researcher(s)&rsquo; name(s), contact information and affiliation(s) in the very  first paragraph.</li>
        <li>A  statement that the study involves <u>research </u>should be included in one of  the first few sentences of the consent form. </li>
        <li>A  statement that identifies the funding source of the research project (if  applicable). </li>
        <li>Near the  beginning, clearly state the purpose(s) of the research project.</li>
        <li>Provide the  reason(s) why the participant has been chosen/asked to participate.</li>
        <li>Describe  procedures (including length of time assessment/participation will require,  number of questions included in a survey, etc.) that will be used to collect  data in easily understandable terms and language.</li>
        <li>For questionnaires/surveys/instruments that  may be sensitive in nature, include in the consent form a sample question(s)  from the questionnaire/survey/instrument so that each participant is fully  informed prior to giving consent.</li>
        <li>Clearly identify any procedures that are  experimental. </li>
        <li>A disclosure of appropriate  alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, which might be  advantageous to the participant, must be included. </li>
        <li>List the benefits to the participants.</li>
        <li>List the physical and/or psychological risks  to participants.</li>
        <li>For studies  that have the potential of being psychologically/emotionally distressful, a  resource list of at least three mental health providers must be given to all  participants. ho is responsible for covering expenses incurred in  the event that the participant requires attention from a mental health  provider. If the TxState Counseling Center  is listed as a referral, and if your participants are registered TxState  students, please state that mental health services at the Counseling Center  are free to registered students, though the number of sessions allowed may be  limited. </li>
        <li>A protocol for the implementation of  emergency medical procedures must be listed for studies with any risk of  physical harm/medical complications to participants.ho is responsible for covering medical  expenses incurred in the event that the participant requires medical attention.</li>
        <li>Give the details of any compensation offered  to participants (e.g., the amount of money on a gift card, the amount of extra  credit, etc.). If extra credit is provided to students who choose to  participate, it must be stated that an alternative form of extra credit will be  made available to students who choose not to participate. This alternative form  of extra credit must be clearly described. Researcher should ensure that the  alternative form of extra credit is comparable to the requirements of the  study.</li>
        <li>A statement that participation is voluntary  and participants may withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice or  jeopardy to their standing with the University and any other relevant  organization/entity with which the participant is associated.</li>
        <li>A statement that participants may choose to  not answer any question(s) for any reason.&nbsp; </li>
        <li>A statement that pertinent questions about  the research, research participants' rights, and/or research-related injuries  to participants should be directed to the IRB chair, Dr. Jon Lasser (512-245-3413  &ndash; <a href="mailto:lasser@txstate.edu">lasser@txstate.edu</a>), or to Ms. Becky  Northcut, Compliance Specialist (512-245-2102).&nbsp; </li>
        <li>Regarding the data collection procedures, the  consent form must include a statement of confidentiality or anonymity.&nbsp; If the data collection is conducted in such a  fashion where the participant is known to the researcher and the participant&rsquo;s  name can be matched to his/her data, the data collection procedure is  confidential.&nbsp; If not, then the data  collection procedure is anonymous.</li>
        <li>Regarding data records and record keeping,  include a statement describing the extent, if any, to which confidentiality of  records identifying the participant will be maintained, and how and where they  will be secured.</li>
        <li>The location and length of time the survey  data, videotapes, audio recordings etc. will be kept must be explicitly stated.</li>
        <li>The consent form must state that a summary of  the findings will be provided to participants upon completion of the study, if  requested. Researcher should include instructions for participant with regard  to how to access results of study.</li>
        <li>On the consent form, the IRB approval number  must be clearly noted.&nbsp; </li>
        <li>In most circumstances, participants (or  parent/guardian) and researchers must sign the consent form. If the data  collection is to be conducted anonymously, then signed consent forms must be  collected separately from other data (e.g. surveys, experimental behavior,  etc.). In some instances, a signed consent form might not be required/desired,  but such instances must be approved by the IRB, requiring that the applicant  provide the IRB with sufficient rationale for the complete omission of a signed  consent form. The IRB may waive the requirement for a signed consent form for  some or all participants if it finds either of the following:
          <ol type="a">
            <li>That the only       record linking the participant and the research would be the consent form, <u>and the principal risk associated with the study is the potential harm       resulting from a breach of confidentiality</u>. In that event, each       participant will be asked whether the participant wants documentation       linking the participant with the research, and the participant's wishes       will govern; or</li>
            <li>That the       research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to participants and       involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required       outside of the research context. However, in cases in which the       requirement to have signed consent forms is waived, the researcher must       still provide participants with a written statement describing the research.       This document is often a consent form with the signature lines removed.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      
        <li>If the data is collected via an  internet-based survey, the consent form must be included for the respondent to  review before starting the online survey. Furthermore, each participant must  indicate that he/she fully understands the consent form and its contents before  participation is allowed. This is typically done by including a &ldquo;check box&rdquo; or  some similar &ldquo;field&rdquo; that would allow the participant to consent/agree to  participate simply by clicking on the field/box. </li>
        <li>Research that involves children must include  documentation of &ldquo;Assent.&rdquo; This can be achieved by including a separate  document that is intended to meet the federal mandates that require researchers  to seek and obtain assent from minors for their participation in research when  those minors are capable of providing assent (typically those who are 8 years  old and older). Assent may also be acquired by including a signature line on  the parental consent form for the minor to sign. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Participants must receive a copy of the  consent form for all data collection protocols. For internet-based surveys,  participants should be instructed to print the consent document for their  records. </li>
        <li>Signature lines for both the participant and  the researcher. </li>
        <li>The consent form should  neither ask nor imply that subjects are waiving any rights or releasing you  from liability.</li>
      </ol>
