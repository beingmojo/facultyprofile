This research project (IRB #2008V4489) is being conducted by Chris Murr who is a doctoral student in the 
Department of Geography at Texas State University-San Marcos.  He can be reached via email at cm18@txstate.edu. The purpose of the research, which involves human subjects, is to assess the potential barriers to the communication of geographic knowledge to student populations in higher education. You have been selected for this research because you are attending an institution of higher education that offers a geography program. 
<p>
The research data will be collected via web-based instrument at www.txstate.edu/~cm18/index.html and, depending on the survey you are selected to complete, may take between 5 – 10 minutes to finish (maximum of 38 questions) and should cause minimal, if any, eye fatigue. If you prefer completing a hardcopy or phone survey, contact the researcher, Chris Murr.  The data will be analyzed using statistical models to determine potential barriers to the transmission of geographic knowledge. Also, the data submitted via the web-based survey will be retained on the server for no more than one month. Only Chris Murr, and possibly the members of his dissertation committee, will have access to the data. Likewise, subjects will be coded by visual impairment type during analysis.
<p>
Participation is strictly voluntary, and your may answer only those questions to which you wish to respond. All answers will be kept strictly confidential and maintained on a secure server at Texas State University. Participants who wish can be considered for one of four $50 Amazon.com gift certificates. To be considered for this online gift certificate, a participant will need to provide their email address, which will be shared with no other parties.  The only exception is for gift certificate recipients.  Their email addresses will be shared with Amazon.com only in order to transmit the gift certificates to the recipients.
