The research data will be collected via web-based instrument at www.txstate.edu/~cm18/index.html and, depending on the survey you are selected to complete, may take between 5 – 10 minutes to finish.  The data will be analyzed using statistical models to determine potential barriers to the transmission of geographic knowledge. Also, the data submitted via the web-based survey will be retained on the server for no more than one month.
