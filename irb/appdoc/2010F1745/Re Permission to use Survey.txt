Good Afternoon,
 
My name is Cedric (Sea-dric) Scott, and I am a graduate student at Texas State University – San 
Marcos, Texas.  I am studying to get my master’s degree in Occupational Education.  Currently, 
I’m in the process of writing my research proposal – Gender Discrimination in the Workplace.  I 
recently read the attached article, and I wanted to request permission to use some of the 
questions from survey on pages 347 & 348 .  Specifically, the following:
*         Sections I – Gender Discrimination of Self questions: 1,2,3,6,7 and 8.
*         Section II – Gender Discrimination of Others questions: 
9,10,13,14,15,16,17,18,21, 23 and 24
*         Section V – Response of Self (A. Gender Discrimination) questions:  43 - 47
 
I will be creating a survey for to administer to my sample.  Some of the questions, I would 
customize some of the question to be specific to my research topic.  However, I would greatly 
appreciate your assistance with this request.
 
Sincerely,
